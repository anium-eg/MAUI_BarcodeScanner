# MAUI Barcode Scanner

MAUI version of the barcode scanner.

Items will be added to the cart only if they are present in the inventory. Currently, the inventory is represented by a hard-coded dummy dependency acting as a data source.

Since there is no real login service hosted, the login delay is simulated by pinging google.com
